# Who ignored Smart Choices?
Takes a CSV file from Heap and makes it easier to process in Excel.

# How to use it:
- Download the CSV file from Heap for the report "Who is ignoring smart choices?"
- Save the rb file in the directory of your CSV download.
- in the command line in that directory, run:

  ruby csvParser.rb nameOfFile.csv
- Check that directory for the output file, which will also be named in the console output. The console output tells you all the matches and non-matches it identified as well.
